# Timeloop

NVIDIA/MIT

Timeloop (Sparseloop) is an infrastructure that aims to provide modeling, mapping and code-generation for Explicitly-Decoupled Data Orchestration (EDDO) architectures, with a focus on for dense- and sparse- tensor algebra workloads.

- Mapping exploration with Timeloop
- Energy estimation with Accelergy

## Installation
