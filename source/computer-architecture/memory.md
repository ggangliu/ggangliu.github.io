# Cache Coherence and Memory Consistency

## Cache coherence

Cache Coherence describes the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location.

It is concerned with the ordering of writes to a single memory location.

## Memory consistency

Memory consistency describes the behavior of reads and writes in relation to other locations.

Consistency is the specification of correctness for memory accesses, defining guarantees on when loads and stores will happen and when they will be seen by the different cores.

It handles the ordering of reads and writes to all memory locations
