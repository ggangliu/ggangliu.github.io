## Introduction

In this work, we present a generalized methodology for implementing hardware extensions for multi-core RISC-V-based GPUs. Our generalized
solution addresses both the ISA and microarchitecture changes.

Figure 1 illustrates an overview of a standard GPU pipeline with
custom fixed-function units A, B, and C (see yellow blocks).
