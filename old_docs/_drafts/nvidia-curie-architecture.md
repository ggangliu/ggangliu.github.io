The GeForce 6800 XE was a graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on September 30th, 2005. Built on the 130 nm process, and based on the NV40 graphics processor, the card supports DirectX 9.0c. Since GeForce 6800 XE does not support DirectX 11 or DirectX 12, it might not be able to run all the latest games. The NV40 graphics processor is an average sized chip with a die area of 287 mmÂ² and 222 million transistors. It features 8 pixel shaders and 3 vertex shaders, 8 texture mapping units, and 8 ROPs. Due to the lack of unified shaders you will not be able to run recent games at all (which require unified shader/DX10+ support). NVIDIA has paired 256 MB DDR2 memory with the GeForce 6800 XE, which are connected using a 128-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 275 MHz, memory is running at 266 MHz.
